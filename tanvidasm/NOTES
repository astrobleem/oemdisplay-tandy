Notes on Video Programs
-----------------------

These are some old programs I had lying around.  I wrote them for a kid who 
wanted to know how to program Tandy video.  Every once in a while somebody 
will ask in comp.sys.tandy for information on Tandy video, so I decided to 
put them on my ftp site.  The programs are simple screen savers.  <esc> 
exits out of them.

Tanbox shows how to detect, enter, leave, and set pixels in Tandy 1000/PCjr 
320x200x16 mode.  It displays random rectangles on the screen with changing 
colors.  Tandots shows how to detect, enter, leave, and set pixels in Tandy 
1000SL/TL/RL 640x200x16 mode.  It uses random dots to change colors on the 
screen in a kind of dissolve.

These programs are not terribly efficient, and you can get better, more 
complete information from other sources (particularly the technical 
reference manual for your system; see the Tandy 1000-series FAQ).  Tandy 
video has a lot of features, including a programmable palette, palette 
mask, and paging in graphics modes, but I don't go into all that here.  
Somebody should do a definitive reference for Tandy video, but it's really 
not on my "to do" list.

One important problem I don't deal with here is the matter of video memory.  
On the Tandy 1000's, video memory may be shared with conventional, so you 
need to make sure that your program won't clobber itself (or another 
program) when it writes to the screen.  Make sure that your program's 
memory block extends to the end of conventional RAM, then make sure that 
the part of conventional that may overlap with video is not in use by your 
program.  In other words, if you need 32k for 320x200x16 mode, make sure 
that you own the last 16k of conventional RAM and are not using it (at 
least 16k will always be set aside exclusively for video).  If you need 64k 
for 640x200x16 mode, make sure that you own the last 48k of conventional 
RAM, and that you don't have code, data, or stack there.  That sort of 
thing.
