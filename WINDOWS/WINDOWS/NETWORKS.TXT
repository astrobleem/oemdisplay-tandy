NOTES ON NETWORK SUPPORT IN WINDOWS 3.0
=======================================

This document contains important information that is not included
in the Windows User's Guide or in on-line Help. The topics 
include:

  *  Notes for system administrators who are installing Windows 
     on a network server

  *  Notes for users who are running a shared copy of Windows 
     from a network server

  *  General notes addressing various problems and network 
     behavior

  *  Information for running Windows on a diskless workstation

  *  Specific notes about different networks and the network 
     categories that are recognized by Windows Setup

  *  A table showing which Windows functions are available with 
     specific networks

You can find more information about setting up and using Windows
with a network in Chapter 4, "File Manager," Chapter 5, "Control 
Panel," Chapter 6, "Print Manager," and Chapter 14, "Networks and
Windows," in the Windows User's Guide.  


INSTALLING WINDOWS ON A NETWORK SERVER
======================================

The following information, in conjunction with the procedures 
outlined in Chapter 14, "Networks and Windows," in the Windows 
User's Guide, will help you install a copy of Windows on a shared
network drive so that several users can run it. 

  *  You must set all files in the shared Windows directory to 
     Read Only. You can do this from within Windows File Manager
     or by using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command. If the files do not 
     have a read-only status, sharing violations and other 
     unpredictable behavior might occur when you run Windows.

  *  Make sure that the shared Windows directory does not contain
     files named SYSTEM.INI, WIN.INI, or WIN.COM. Setup creates 
     these files in each user's personal Windows directory.


RUNNING A SHARED COPY OF WINDOWS FROM A NETWORK SERVER
======================================================

If you have problems running a copy of Windows you installed with
Setup from a shared network directory, here are a few things to 
try. Make sure that you followed the procedures outlined in 
Chapter 14, "Networks and Windows," in the Windows User's Guide.

  *  Make sure your personal Windows directory and the shared 
     Windows directory are both on your path, and in that order. 
     Setup should take care of this for you.

  *  Ask your system administrator to remove the MS-DOS SHARE 
     command from your system. With some networks, the MS-DOS 
     SHARE utility must not be loaded on your workstation if you 
     want to run a shared copy of Windows.

  *  If you see sharing violations when you try to run an 
     application that is stored in a shared network directory, 
     make sure that all the application files are set to Read 
     Only. You can check read-only status by listing the contents
     of the shared network directory contents in File Manager. 
     You can set files to Read Only with File Manager. If this 
     does not solve the problem, wait a while and try loading 
     the application again.


GENERAL NOTES
=============

The following notes apply to most networks. They explain some 
behavior you might observe and offer remedies for some problems 
encountered while running Windows.

  *  Many networks will fail if you log in or log out at the DOS
     Prompt while running Windows. Always perform these functions
     from the network section of Control Panel, if your network 
     supports them.

  *  There are many settings in the SYSTEM.INI file that affect 
     the way Windows interacts with a network. You can change 
     these settings to correct any problems you might have 
     operating Windows with your network. See the SYSINI.TXT 
     on-line documents for instructions about changing the 
     following SYSTEM.INI settings:

        [Boot]
        Network.drv=

        [Standard]
        Int28Filter=
        NetAsyncSwitching=
        NetHeapSize=

        [386enh]
        AllVMsExclusive=
        EMMExclude=
        FileSysChange=
        InDOSPolling=
        Int28Critical=
        NetAsyncFallback=
        NetAsyncTimeout=
        NetDMASize=
        Network=
        PSPIncrement=
        ReflectDOSInt2A=
        TimerCriticalSection=
        TokenRingSearch=
        UniqueDOSPSP=

  *  If you have problems running Windows or other applications 
     with your network software loaded in the high-memory area 
     (the HMA, or first 64K of extended memory), try disabling 
     the network's HMA option. Consult your network documentation
     for more information.

  *  If your network is loaded in the upper-memory region 
     between 640K and 1 megabyte, you might have problems running
     Windows. If so, try loading the network in conventional 
     memory.

  *  On some networks, redirected drives look different in Windows
     than they did without Windows. For example, a device 
     redirected as \\server\share\directory might appear in 
     Windows simply as \\server\share.

  *  You might need to mark applications stored on a network 
     directory as Read Only to prevent sharing violations when 
     they are run by more than one user at a time. You can set 
     the read-only status from within Windows File Manager or by 
     using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command. Most Windows applications 
     require read-only status before they can be shared.

  *  When you install Windows, Setup modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
     file to make sure the Windows directory appears on your path
     ahead of any conflicting directories. However, because of 
     the way some networks implement their startup procedures, a
     network can change this path when you log in. If so, your 
     system administrator must modify the network login procedure
     so that the paths are set correctly to run Windows.

  *  If you have difficulties running Setup, you might have your 
     hardware configured in a way which is incompatible with 
     Setup's hardware detection mechanism. For example, an ARCNET
     network card can be configured to use base address 2E0h 
     which is incompatible with attempts to detect an 8514 video 
     adapter. To avoid this problem, include the /i switch when 
     you run Setup. This switch disables Setup's hardware 
     detection feature. 
	
  *  On some networks, the user's name displayed by Print Manager
     will not match the user's actual log-in name.

  *  If for some reason you use Setup to change your network 
     configuration after you have already installed Windows, 
     Setup might not be able to remove all support for your 
     previous network selection. Unnecessary files might be left
     in your Windows directory, and entries might be left in your
     WIN.INI or SYSTEM.INI files that could harm your system's 
     performance. After changing your configuration in this way,
     check the notes about both your previous and new selections 
     to see if any remaining changes are no longer required.


NOTES ABOUT DISKLESS WORKSTATIONS
=================================

A diskless workstation is a machine that does not have a local 
hard-disk drive, and instead uses network drives for all 
activities. Some diskless workstations do have floppy drives.


Setting Up Windows for a Diskless Workstation
---------------------------------------------
In the case of most diskless workstations, you will be installing
Windows from a shared network directory. To set up Windows, enter 
SETUP /n as explained in Chapter 14, "Networks and Windows," in 
the Windows User's Guide. Setup copies all MS-DOS device drivers 
(such as HIMEM.SYS) to your private Windows directory. When it 
detects that you are running a diskless workstation, it also 
places proposed changes to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files 
there, but does not automatically modify them. Notify your system 
administrator to make the proper modifications for you. The 
changes Windows proposes can be found in CONFIG.WIN and 
AUTOEXEC.WIN.

Windows does not take care of the modification automatically 
because of possible boot-resource conflicts. While some diskless 
workstations can load MS-DOS and MS-DOS device drivers from a 
floppy disk drive, most do so exclusively from the network. 

The machine contains ROMs that allow it to connect to a network 
resource from which it loads MS-DOS, the CONFIG.SYS, and DOS 
device files. This resource might be a directory containing the 
appropriate files, or it might be a binary image of a floppy disk.
In some cases the boot resource is still accessible after the 
boot process has completed. In other cases it will be 
automatically disconnected. In addition, the same boot resource 
might be shared by more than one workstation, so making 
modifications to suit one workstation might adversely affect 
others.

If your boot directory is accessible and you can modify the files
yourself, make sure that it is not being shared by other users 
before making any modifications.


Formatting Floppy Disks on Diskless Workstations
------------------------------------------------
If you are running Windows from a network, you cannot format a 
floppy disk from File Manager. You can, however, do so from the 
DOS Prompt.

  To format a disk on a diskless workstation:

  1.  Choose the DOS Prompt icon from the Main Group in Program 
      Manager.

  2.  Type the following and press ENTER:

         format x:

      where x is the letter for the floppy disk drive that 
      contains the disk you want to format.


NOTES ABOUT SPECIFIC NETWORKS
=============================

In addition to the "General Notes" section, you should also read 
the following topics for notes about running Windows with your 
specific network. You will also find information about some of 
the general categories recognized by Windows Setup in this 
section.


Novell NetWare
---------------
Windows 3.0 will run with Novell NetWare versions 2.10 and later.
However, your NetWare shell components (NET3.COM, NET4.COM, 
NETBIOS.EXE, and IPX.COM) must be version 3.01 or higher. If you 
upgrade your shell components, also upgrade other NetWare 
utilities (such as BINDFIX.EXE and MAKEUSER.EXE) before using 
them with the 3.01 shell.

Upgrades for these components are available through normal Novell
distribution channels. Consult your system administrator for 
instructions on how to install them on your system.


In addition:

  *  If you have a Western Digital Ethercard Plus and have 
     problems accessing drives using the MAP ROOT command, 
     contact Western Digital for an updated driver.

  *  Do not try to log in, log out, attach, or detach a Novell 
     server from the DOS Prompt within Windows. You must perform 
     these operations from Windows Control Panel.

  *  By default, NetWare gives you access to only 40 files at a 
     time. When you are running applications with Windows, you can
     exceed this limit rather quickly. If so, you might see 
     unexpected error messages. To increase the file access limit,
     add the following line to your SHELL.CFG file:

       file handles = 60

  *  If you get unusable output when printing to a NetWare server
     (such as incorrect fonts, garbled text, invalid page breaks,
     or blank lines), you might need to edit your print job 
     configuration. Try using the NetWare PRINTCON utility to set
     the Auto Endcap and Enable Timeout options to No.

  *  If you want to run SWAPFILE.EXE with NetWare, you must 
     disable the NWPOPUP utility temporarily. SWAPFILE can run 
     only if no other applications are running. NWPOPUP is a 
     Windows application that runs invisibly in your system and 
     lets you see incoming network messages.

     To disable the NWPOPUP utility, choose the Disable Broadcast
     Messages option from the Network section of Control Panel. 
     You can then run SWAPFILE normally. After running SWAPFILE, 
     you can use the Enable Broadcast Messages option in the 
     Network section of Control Panel to restart the NWPOPUP 
     utility.

     For more information about setting up swap files and running
     the SWAPFILE utility, see Chapter 13, "Optimizing Windows," 
     in the Windows User's Guide.

  *  If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, paging to a
     drive on a NetWare 286 server might make starting Windows 
     take up to a minute. Chapter 13 of the Windows User's Guide,
     "Optimizing Windows," discusses how to control the location 
     of your paging file.

  *  A NetWare file server does not include the directory entries
     dot (.) and double dot (..) as MS-DOS does. However, the 3.01
     NetWare shell can emulate these entries when applications 
     attempt to list the files in a directory. If you have 
     problems listing files or deleting directories, turning on 
     the Show Dots feature will help. Add the following line to 
     your SHELL.CFG file:

       show dots = on

     Turning on Show Dots will cause problems with earlier 
     versions of some 286-based NetWare utilities, such as 
     BINDFIX.EXE and MAKEUSER.EXE. Make sure you upgrade these
     utilities if you upgrade your NetWare shell.

  *  Redirected drives can look different in Windows than they 
     did without Windows. For example, a device mapped as 
     FileServerName/Volume:Directory will appear in Windows 
     simply as FileServerName/Volume:\, showing the root of the 
     file server's shared volume, rather than the subdirectory 
     you expected. If so, you can correct this with the MAP ROOT 
     entry explained in the following information.

  *  In some cases Windows will reset the default directory on a
     drive to the root of the volume. This might upset your 
     configuration if, for example, your path includes the 
     current directory on a network drive (that is, your path 
     includes a drive letter without a specific directory, such 
     as z: instead of z:\system).

     You can prevent this problem by using MAP.EXE and LOGIN.EXE 
     versions 3.0 and later to set up fake roots. This feature 
     simulates the MS-DOS SUBST command, which sets the root of a
     given drive to a directory designated by the user instead of
     to the true root of the volume.

     For example, say you normally mapped F: to the HOME\TERRY 
     directory on the SERVER\SYS volume, and then included F: in 
     your path. You would do this by including the following 
     command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by typing the command 
     before starting Windows:

       map f:=count\sys:home\terry

     The default directory on F: would then be HOME\TERRY. To 
     prevent Windows from changing this, you would replace the 
     command above with the one shown below:

       map root f:=count\sys:home\terry

     This command would make the directory HOME\TERRY appear to be 
     the root of the F: drive.

  *  If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you can 
     adjust the way Windows handles your network drive mappings 
     by adding the following entries to the [NetWare] section of 
     your SYSTEM.INI file:

       RestoreDrives=false

     Normally, when you exit Windows, all of your drive mappings 
     are restored to the way they were before you started Windows,
     and all changes you made inside Windows are lost. If you set
     the RestoreDrives value to false, the mappings you made 
     inside Windows will remain when you exit Windows.

       NWShareHandles=true

     Normally, each virtual machine you start from Windows will 
     have its own set of drive mappings. Changes you make in one 
     virtual machine will not affect another. If you set the 
     NWShareHandles value to true, drive mappings will instead 
     be global, and changes made in one virtual machine will 
     affect all other applications.

     See the SYSINI.TXT on-line document for instructions about 
     creating and changing settings.

  *  The Windows NetWare driver can be invoked through the 
     Windows Control Panel, and will present the user with a list
     of network functions. Network administrators can modify this
     list by installing a customized NETWARE.INI file in the 
     user's Windows directory. See the Network section of 
     Control Panel's on-line Help for details.

  *  When installing for Novell NetWare, Windows Setup adds the 
     following entry to the [windows] section of your WIN.INI
     file:

        load=nwpopup.exe

     This automatically starts the NetWare popup utility, which
     displays your incoming broadcast messages.


Microsoft Network and Compatibles
----------------------------------
The following notes apply to the general category of networks 
that support the MS-DOS network interface and Netbios protocols.

  *  Due to the way some of these networks handle print queues, 
     Print Manager cannot distinguish multiple print queues on 
     the same server. The lists of print jobs in these queues 
     might be displayed improperly.

  *  Due to the way some of these networks handle print queues, 
     Print Manager might not be able to display the job title 
     when displaying queue information.
 
Microsoft LAN Manager Networks
------------------------------
Many networks are based upon Microsoft LAN Manager. Consult your 
network documentation, network distributor, or system admini-
strator to learn whether your network falls into this category, 
and if so, on which version of LAN Manager it is based.

  *  Network software based on DOS LAN Manager 1.x Basic must not
     be loaded in the high-memory area (the first 64K of extended 
     memory) on MS-DOS 4.x. Consult your network administrator to
     determine if these conditions apply to your workstation. 

  *  Some early copies of LAN Manager 1.x will require a
     maintenance upgrade to run with Windows. If you experience
     problems, contact your network vendor for an upgrade.

  *  LAN Manager Enhanced lets you to use popup services to see 
     incoming broadcast messages. These popup services can disrupt 
     the Windows display, so you must either disable them or run 
     the LAN Manager WinPopup utility so they can coexist with 
     Windows.

     The WinPopup utility should be located in your LAN Manager 
     NETPROG directory, included on your path. To automatically 
     start the utility when you start Windows, you must include 
     the following entry in the [windows] section of your WIN.INI:
 
       load=winpopup.exe

     If you install Windows for LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced, this
     is taken care of for you. If you are running LAN Manager 
     1.x Enhanced, you must insert this line yourself. See 
     WININI.TXT for information on modifying your WIN.INI file.

     NOTE  The WinPopup utility included with LAN Manager 1.x 
	   will not run in standard or 386 enhanced mode. Request
	   an upgrade from your network manufacturer if you want 
	   to run popup services with Windows.

     Alternatively, if you want to disable the popup services, 
     use the following procedure:

       1. Find your LAN Manager root directory.
        
       2. Use Notepad to open the LANMAN.INI file and locate the
           line that begins with "wrkservices=".
  
       3. Remove the "messenger" and "netpopup" entries from this 
          line.

       4. Save the file.

       5. Exit Windows and restart your computer.

  *  For Windows to support LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced, you must 
     have the files NETAPI.DLL and PMSPL.DLL. These files should 
     already be located in your LAN Manager NETPROG directory, 
     which should be on your path.

  *  If you are running Windows from the OS/2 version 1.2 DOS 
     Compatibility Box, you must configure your printer drivers 
     to use the special .OS2 printer ports. See the on-line 
     document called README.TXT for more information.


3Com Networks
-------------
Make sure you select the proper 3Com option when you install 
Windows, as outlined in Chapter 14, "Networks and Windows," in 
the Windows User's Guide.

  *  The 3Com 3+Share network is based on the Microsoft Network 
     product and will be handled as such by Windows. See the 
     "Microsoft Network and Compatibles" section earlier in
     this document.

  *  The 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager network is based on Microsoft 
     LAN Manager and will be handled as such by Windows. See the
     "Microsoft LAN Manager Networks" section earlier in this
     document.

In addition:

  *  If you install Windows for 3Com 3+Share or 3Com 3+Open LAN
     Manager (XNS only), Setup makes the following entry in the 
     [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:

       TimerCriticalSection=10000

     This setting is required if you are running Windows in 386 
     mode and are using the 3Com XNS protocol stack.

     If you are running 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager and are not using
     the XNS stack, choose the standard LAN Manager entry in 
     Setup. Choosing this option will not put the above entry in 
     your SYSTEM.INI file.

     If you want to use the XNS stack, but did not install 
     3Com networks with Setup, you need to insert the above entry
     yourself. For example, you might be using the 3Com XNS stack
     with another network.

     If you are not using the 3Com XNS stack and you experience
     performance problems, make sure the TimerCriticalSection
     entry is not included in your SYSTEM.INI file. 

  *  Some copies of 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager version 1.1 will
     require a maintenance upgrade to work with Windows. If you
     have problems, contact your 3Com customer support
     organization.

  *  When you install Windows, Setup modifies your AUTOEXEC.BAT
     file to make sure the Windows directory appears on your path
     ahead of any conflicting directories. However, because of 
     the way that 3+Share implements its startup procedures, the 
     network might change this path when you log in. If so, your 
     system administrator must modify the network log-in 
     procedure so that the paths are set correctly to run Windows. 

  *  On a 3Com 3+Open network, the user's name displayed by Print
     Manager might not match the user's actual log-in name. 

  *  Some 3Com 3Station diskless workstations come with an All
     ChargeCard. Make sure your machine is not configured to load
     the network into the upper-memory region between 640K and 1 
     megabyte, as this will not work reliably with Windows 3.0 in
     standard mode.

  *  If you use the 3C505 Network Adaptor Card, you must disable 
     the 3Com Link Plus to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode. You 
     can disable it by removing the following lines from your 
     CONFIG.SYS file:

        device=psh.sys <arguments>
        device=pth.sys

     In addition, remove the following line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
     (or other batch file you use to start your network):

        ldr

  *  When you install for 3Com 3+Share or 3Com 3+Open LAN Manager
     (XNS only), Setup adds the following entries to the [386enh]
     section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

        TimerCriticalSection=10000
        UniqueDOSPSP=true
        PSPIncrement=5

     See SYSINI3.TXT for more information on these entries.


IBM PC LAN Program
-------------------
The IBM PC LAN Program is based on the Microsoft Network product 
and should be handled as such by Windows. However, select the IBM
PC LAN Program option during Setup to ensure that your system 
options are configured correctly.

In addition:

  *  The IBM PCLP Extended Services refers to network drives and 
     printers by two different names. Usually, when connecting 
     to a network, you select connections from a list containing
     descriptive names, but internally connections are made using
     hidden names such as \\SERVER\IBMXS001.
     
     With PCLP Extended Services, you must type the same name as 
     the hidden names in Control Panel or File Manager to make 
     new network connections. Consult your network administrator
     to learn the proper names to use.

  *  Some versions of PCLP lock up your system if you receive a 
     broadcast message while running Windows. You can disable 
     these messages with the NET PAUSE MESSENGER command. Or you 
     can start up your network with NET START RDR instead of NET 
     START RCV or NET START MSG commands.

  *  When installing for IBM PC LAN Program, Setup adds the 
     following entries to the [386Enh] section of your 
     SYSTEM.INI file:

        INDOSpolling=true

     See the on-line document, SYSINI2.TXT, for more information 
     on these entries.


Banyan VINES
------------
Banyan VINES 4.0 is compatible with Microsoft Network, and will 
be handled as such by Windows. However, choose the Banyan VINES 
option from Setup to ensure that your system options are 
configured correctly.

In addition:

  *  To run Windows in 386 enhanced mode, you must install VINES 
     4.0 site-specific patch 0H. This patch is available at no 
     cost through your Banyan support channel.

  *  To use Windows printing functions over VINES, you must have 
     the NETBIOS support loaded. If you cannot print to a network 
     printer, ask your network administrator to verify that you 
     are loading NETBIOS.

  *  If you want to run non-Windows applications that use NETBIOS, 
     contact your Banyan support specialist for information.

  *  In 386 enhanced mode, Windows supports only one application 
     using NETBIOS at a time. When you are printing to a network 
     printer from a Windows application or running any other 
     applications that use NETBIOS, make sure no other virtual 
     machines are running in the background. 

  *  When you install for Banyan VINES 4.0, Setup adds the 
     following entry to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI 
     file:

        TimerCriticalSection=5000

     See SYSINI3.TXT for more information on this entry and its 
     purpose.


AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS FOR YOUR NETWORK?
=====================================

The following table shows Windows functions that are available for specific
networks. To find information for your network, match the abbreviation next 
to its name in the following list with the same abbreviation at the top of
the table.
