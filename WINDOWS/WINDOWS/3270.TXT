USING NON-WINDOWS 3270 APPLICATIONS
===================================

This on-line document describes some specific problems you 
might encounter when running non-Windows 3270 emulation 
products with Windows 3.0. 


Starting 3270 Applications
--------------------------
You can start most 3270 emulator products as memory-
resident applications (also known as terminate-and-stay-
resident, or T&SRs). Most memory-resident applications 
are incompatible with a multitasking environment such as 
Windows, and should not be started before you start 
Windows, especially when running Windows 386 enhanced mode.                
                                                                   
However, some other applications can be started before you
start Windows. Only attempt this if the documentation you
received with the application specifies that it will work.
In all other cases, start Windows first, and then run your 
emulator from a DOS Prompt, or directly from Windows 
Program Manager.  


Getting Optimal Performance with 3270 Applications
--------------------------------------------------
High-speed communications programs like 3270 emulators run 
successfully when you run Windows 3.0 in 386 enhanced mode. 
However, when running in real or standard mode, you must 
select the Prevent Program Switch option in the 3270 
emulator's PIF to ensure against accidental loss of your 
mainframe connection.

When running in 386 enhanced mode, you will achieve the best 
results by using the following recommendations:

  *  Start all 3270 emulation utilities from the DOS prompt.

  *  Make sure the virtual machine can run in the background 
     by setting the background bit in the virtual machine's 
     Settings dialog box or in the PIF you use to start the 
     machine. This should prevent your mainframe session 
     from being disconnected when you run other applications.

  *  For the best results, run all 3270 emulation 
     applications full screen. 

  *  If you do run your 3270 emulator in a window, do not
     use your mouse to select text. Selecting text in this
     way will temporarily suspend your application and
     might cause your mainframe session to be disconnected.

  *  To use file send and file receive utilities, you must 
     set the Memory Required parameter for COMMAND.PIF 
     so that enough memory is available to load both the 
     emulator and the utilities at the same time. See the 
     3270 emulator's documentation for memory requirements 
     and recommendations for system settings.

  *  If you are running Windows in standard or real mode, 
     and cannot use Windows hotkeys to switch away from your 
     3270 emulator or to copy the emulator's screen to the        
     Clipboard, the emulator is probably intercepting the 
     hotkeys before Windows receives them. 

     Try using a hotkey to switch from the host session to 
     the DOS session being maintained by the emulator. This 
     usually causes the emulator to pass the keystrokes on 
     to Windows, thereby allowing you to switch tasks.

See Chapter 12, "More About Application," in the Windows User's 
Guide for more information about PIFs and memory-resident
applications.


IBM Personal Communications/3270 (PCS)
--------------------------------------
  *  PCS reserves specific keys for switching between the host 
     and the MS-DOS sessions. These "hot keys" conflict with the 
     following keys reserved for use by Windows 3.0:
           
       CTRL+ESC
       ALT+TAB
       ALT+ESC
            
     To redefine these key combinations, use a keyboard 
     definition file. You can find the proper procedure in your 
     PCS product documentation.

  *  If you want your 286-based PS/2 computer configured to use 
     expanded memory, you must add the following line to your 
     CONFIG.SYS file:

       device=PCSX2EMS.SYS

     When you ran Setup to install Windows and chose to let 
     Windows modify your CONFIG.SYS, this line was removed. 
     Check the backup, CONFIG.OLD for the exact entry you must 
     add.

     See your PCS documentation for further information on
     using PCSX2EMS.SYS.

  *  Make sure you always unload PCS before exiting the MS-DOS 
     session where PCS was initialized.

  *  If your computer is configured so that no EMS page frame
     is available, you must prevent PCS from using expanded
     memory. Create a program information file (PIF) for 
     PCS and include these settings:

       EMS Memory KB Required  0
       EMS Memory KB Limit     0

     For information about creating a PIF, see Chapter 12,
     "More About Applications," in the Windows User's Guide.   
  
  *  If you access PCS via a gateway on PCLP or Token Ring 
     networks, you must prevent other applications from trying
     to run while PCS is running. Select the Exclusive option 
     in the PIF for PCS to ensure safe operation.


DCA IRMAX  or IrmaLan
---------------------
  *  Make sure the DCA keyboard is loaded before you start
     Windows by including the following line in your CONFIG.SYS 
     file:

        device=kybddrv.sys -1b

     If you are running Windows in real or standard mode, 
     you must toggle to the DOS session before using Windows 
     hotkeys to switch tasks. If you do not, the driver might 
     intercept keystrokes meant for another non-Windows 
     application and send them to the host.         

  *  If you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode, add the 
     following line to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI 
     file:

        LOCAL=EXTKYBD

     See the on-line document SYSINI3.TXT for information about
     the procedure.

  *  If you want to paste information from the Windows Clipboard 
     to IRMAX, clear the Allow Fast Paste check box in the 
     Advanced Options of the DCA's PIF.


DCA IRMA Plus+
--------------
You will not be able to terminate IRMA Plus as usual. If you 
press Shift+Shift to switch to the Host, and then press Shift+F6
to exit the emulator, you will return to the DOS prompt, not to
the IRMA Pop-up program box. At this point, you can press 
ALT+TAB and return to Windows, but you cannot exit the emulator.  

To terminate properly, create the following batch file:

  echo off
  cls
  %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
  echo MICROSOFT WINDOWS POP-UP SUPPORT
  echo Your pop-up program has been loaded and you may activate 
  it as echo you would normally. When you have finished using 
  this pop-up echo program, exit it or press any key to return 
  to Windows.
  pause
  command /c echo Done

Name the batch file E7.BAT. Create a PIF for IRMA Plus. Enter 
e7.bat as the Program Name, and e7.com as an optional parameter.  

  NOTE:  This batch file and its associated PIF file can be used 
         for other programs that terminate abnormally. Be sure 
         that you enter the appropriate application name as the
         optional parameter.


Attachmate Extra or Extra Gateway 
----------------------------------
  *  If you have problems switching away from Extra Gateway, 
     answer Yes to the question "Will you be using Windows 386?" 
     in the Extra Gateway configuration program. Answering Yes 
     enables the -CQ option in your EXTRA.BAT file.

  *  To ensure proper termination of Extra, clear the Close
     Window on Exit option (remove the X) in PIF for Extra.
     Alternately, you can use the E7.BAT file as explained in
     the previous topic, "DCA IRMA Plus+."
