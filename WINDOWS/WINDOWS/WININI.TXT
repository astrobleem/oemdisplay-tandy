WININI.TXT
----------


  NOTE: This is the first of two files that contain
        information about WIN.INI. The second file, named
        WININI2.TXT, is a continuation of the information
        presented here.


INTRODUCTION
------------

WIN.INI is one of two Windows initialization files that are
included with Windows. Windows initialization files contain
information that defines your Windows environment. Windows
and Windows applications can use the information stored in
these files to configure themselves to meet your needs and
preferences.

There are two standard Windows initialization files:

  * WIN.INI, which primarily contains settings that allow
    you to alter your Windows environment according to your
    preferences.

  * SYSTEM.INI, which primarily contains settings that allow
    you to customize Windows to meet your system's hardware
    needs.

This document describes the contents of the WIN.INI file and
explains how to change settings in the file.

For information on the SYSTEM.INI file, see the SYSINI.TXT
file.

  CAUTION: Changing settings can lead to undesirable results
           when you run Windows. Before changing any
           setting, read "Changing Settings" later in this
           document.


FORMAT
------

Windows initialization files have the following format:

  [section name]
  keyname=value

In this example, [section name] is the name of a section.
Sections are used to break settings into logical groups. The
enclosing brackets ([]) are required, and the left bracket
must be in the leftmost column on the screen.

The keyname=value statement defines the value of each
setting. A keyname is the name of a setting. It can consist
of any combination of letters and digits, and must be
followed immediately by an equal sign (=). The value can be
an integer, a string, or a quoted string, depending on the
setting.

You can include comments in initialization files. You must
begin each line of comments with a semicolon (;).


HOW TO READ LISTINGS IN THIS DOCUMENT
-------------------------------------

In this document, WIN.INI settings are listed alphabetically
within the sections that contain them. These sections appear
in WIN.INI and in this document in the following order
(however, the order of these sections is not important):

  [windows]
  [desktop]
  [extensions]
  [intl]
  [ports]
  [fonts]
  [PrinterPorts]
  [devices]
  [colors]

In addition, some Windows applications may add or insert
other sections.

The settings do not appear alphabetically in WIN.INI. If you
want to change a setting, you will have to search for it
within the appropriate section.

The syntax, purpose, and recommended method for changing
each setting appear in the following format:

------------------------------------------------------------
SettingName=<value-type>
  Default: This is Windows' built-in value for this setting.
  Purpose: This paragraph briefly describes the function of
           the setting and its default value (if
           applicable).
  To change: This sentence states the recommended method
           for changing the value of this setting.
------------------------------------------------------------

The <value-type> indicates whether the value should be a
number, a letter, a range of numbers, or something else.

A setting that is listed in this document but that does not
appear in your WIN.INI file has the default value.


CHANGING SETTINGS
-----------------

Windows created the WIN.INI file when you installed Windows.
All of the settings contained in this file were set to
default values defined by Windows.

You might want to change one or more of these values in
order to change the appearance or performance of Windows to
suit your needs.

There are two ways to change WIN.INI settings:

* You can use Control Panel to change most settings.

* Use a text editor such as Notepad to edit the WIN.INI
  file directly. (Don't use a formatting editor; it can
  corrupt your WIN.INI file.)

You can change most settings in WIN.INI by using Control
Panel. By doing so, you avoid opening WIN.INI as a text
file, where it is easier to make mistakes.

For more information on Control Panel, see Chapter 5,
"Control Panel," in the User's Guide.

For the settings you cannot change by using Control Panel,
you must open the WIN.INI file, edit it using a text editor
such as Notepad, and then restart Windows. For more
information on how to use Notepad, see Chapter 10,
"Additional Accessories," in the User's Guide.

  CAUTION: You should use care when making changes to your
           WIN.INI file using a text editor. Incorrect
           changes to WIN.INI can lead to unexpected
           results when you run Windows. In addition, some
           editors can damage certain characters (those
           with ANSI values of greater than 127). It is
           recommended that you use Notepad as a text
           editor. The listings in this document indicate
           which settings you can change using Control
           Panel. Use Control Panel whenever possible.

           Always back up your WIN.INI file before you
           open it.


UPDATING WIN.INI FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF WINDOWS
--------------------------------------------------

If you update your system to Windows version 3.0 from
Windows version 2.x, Setup will automatically update your
WIN.INI file by making the following changes:

In the [windows] section, Setup will add one setting:

  Documents=

and will clear the old values from another setting:

  Device=

In the [extensions] section, Setup will add two settings:

  pcx=pbrush.exe ^.pcx
  rec=recorder.exe ^.rec

In the [devices] section, Setup will remove all entries. The
previous drivers, fonts, and other resources will remain in
your system. Setup will ask you whether you want to upgrade
to the new driver or stay with the previous one.

Setup leaves all other sections unchanged.

If you are updating to Windows version 3.0 from Windows
version 1.x, Setup will not preserve any values from your
old WIN.INI file.


WHAT IS IN WIN.INI?
-------------------

The settings in the WIN.INI file allow you to personalize
your Windows environment. WIN.INI contains several sections,
each of which consists of a group of related settings. Your
WIN.INI file might not have all of these sections, or it
might have additional sections, depending on your system's
hardware and software requirements. The following sections
can appear in WIN.INI:

This section             Does this
------------             ---------
[windows]                Affects an assortment of elements
                         in your Windows environment.

[desktop]                Controls the appearance of the
                         screen background (desktop) and the
                         positioning of windows and icons.

[extensions]             Associates specified types of
                         files with corresponding
                         applications.

[intl]                   Describes how to display items for
                         countries other than the United
                         States.

[ports]                  Lists all available output ports.
                         These settings are listed in the
                         WININI2.TXT file.

[fonts]                  Describes the screen font files
                         that are loaded by Windows.
                         (These settings are listed in the
                         WININI2.TXT file.)

[PrinterPorts]           Lists active and inactive output
                         devices that can be accessed by
                         Windows. (These settings are listed
                         in the WININI2.TXT file.)


[devices]                Lists active output devices
                         that provide compatibility with
                         Windows 2.x applications. (These
                         settings are listed in the
                         WININI2.TXT file.)


[colors]                 Defines colors for parts of the
                         Windows display. (These settings
                         are listed in the WININI2.TXT
                         file.)


Additional sections might be inserted by other applications.
Consult the application's documentation for information on
those sections.

------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------

[WINDOWS] SECTION

The [windows] section contains settings that affect the
following parts of your Windows environment:

  * Applications that start when you start Windows
  * Warning beep
  * Printing
  * Window border width
  * Keyboard speed
  * Mouse settings
  * Definition of files as documents or programs

The [windows] section can contain the following settings:

------------------------------------------------------------
Beep=<yes-or-no>
  Default: yes
  Purpose: If this setting is enabled, Windows sounds a
           warning beep when you attempt to do something
           that is not allowed.
  To change: Choose the Sound icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
BorderWidth=<number>
  Default: 3
  Purpose: Sets the width of the borders around all the
           windows on your desktop except those (such as
           Control Panel) that have a fixed size. The
           allowed range is 1 (narrowest) to 49 (widest).
  To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
CursorBlinkRate=<milliseconds>
  Default: 530
  Purpose: Indicates how many milliseconds elapse between
           each blink of the selection cursor.
  To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
Device=<output-device-name>, <device-driver>,
       <port-connection>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Defines the default printer. The
           <output-device-name> value can be any device name
           given in the [devices] section. An explicit port
           and driver must be assigned to the device. The
           <device-driver> value is the filename (without
           the extension) of the device-driver file. The
           <port-connection> value is any portname given in
           the [ports] section.
  To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
DeviceNotSelectedTimeout=<seconds>
  Default: 15
  Purpose: Specifies the default number of seconds for
           Windows to wait for a device to be switched on. A
           value is saved for each printer listed in the
           [PrinterPorts] section. If the device is not
           switched on during this time, Windows won't print
           to the device. Note that for some devices,
           Windows immediately posts an error message if the
           device is not already switched on.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file. This
           setting serves only as the system default value.
           To change the value for a particular printer,
           choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel
           window. Using Control Panel changes the
           corresponding value only in the [PrinterPorts]
           section.
------------------------------------------------------------
Documents=<extensions>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Defines files that are to be considered
           "documents" by Windows. Files with the extensions
           listed in the [extensions] section of WIN.INI are
           automatically considered documents. Use this
           setting to define only document file extensions
           that are not in the [extensions] section. The
           extensions listed here are not associated with
           any application. Separate extension names with a
           space, and do not include the preceding periods.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
DoubleClickSpeed=<milliseconds>
  Default: 452
  Purpose: Establishes the maximum amount of time between
           clicks of the mouse button that the system
           will permit for one double-click. The lower the
           value, the less time you have to click twice in
           order to effect a double-click.
  To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
KeyboardSpeed=<milliseconds>
  Default: 31
  Purpose: Establishes how much time elapses between
           repetitions of a character on the display when
           you hold down a keyboard key. This setting does
           not work for all keyboards. If you delete this
           setting from WIN.INI, Windows Setup will not set
           this speed, but the speed will still be set if
           you choose the Keyboard icon in Control Panel
           (even if you cancel out of it).
  To change: Choose the Keyboard icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
Load=<filename(s)>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Specifies one or more applications that are to be
           run as icons when Windows is started. This
           value is a list of one or more filenames of
           applications, or documents that are associated
           with an application, each separated by a space.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
MouseSpeed=<0-or-1-or-2>
  Default: 1
  Purpose: Establishes the relationship between mouse
           movement and cursor movement when the value of
           either MouseThreshold1 or MouseThreshold2 is
           exceeded. When this occurs, Windows causes cursor
           movement to accelerate according to the value of
           MouseSpeed. If it is 0, there is no acceleration.
           If it is 1, the cursor is moved twice the normal
           speed when mouse movement exceeds the value of
           MouseThreshold1. If it is 2, the cursor is moved
           twice the normal speed when mouse movement
           exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1 or four
           times the normal speed if mouse movement exceeds
           MouseThreshold2.
  To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
MouseThreshold1=<pixels>
  Default: 5
  Purpose: Establishes the maximum number of pixels that
           the mouse can move between mouse interrupts
           before Windows alters the relationship between
           mouse movement and cursor movement. If the mouse
           movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is
           greater than zero, Windows moves the cursor at
           twice the normal speed.
  To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
MouseThreshold2=<pixels>
  Default: 10
  Purpose: Establishes the maximum number of pixels that
           the mouse can move between mouse interrupts
           before Windows alters the relationship between
           mouse movement and cursor movement. If the mouse
           movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is
           equal to 2, Windows moves the cursor at four
           times the normal speed.
  To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
NetWarn=<0-or-1>
  Default: 1
  Purpose: Specifies whether Windows should display a
           warning message if your system is configured to
           run a network and the network is not running or
           the wrong network is running. All Windows
           network-related options will be disabled if the
           network is disabled or incorrect. Setting this
           value to 0 will disable the warning message.
  To change: Choose the Network icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
NullPort=<string>
  Default: "None"
  Purpose: Specifies the name used for a null port. This
           name appears in the Printers-Configure dialog box
           in Control Panel when a device is installed (that
           is, the device driver is present) but is not
           connected to any port. This value also appears
           for such a device in the [devices] section of
           WIN.INI.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
Programs=<extensions>
  Default: com exe bat pif
  Purpose: Defines which files Windows regards as
           applications. Extension names are separated by a
           space and do not include the preceding periods.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
Run=<filename(s)>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Tells Windows to run one or more specified
           applications when Windows is started. The value
           is a list of one or more filenames of
           applications, or documents associated with
           applications, each separated by a space.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
Spooler=<yes-or-no>
  Default: yes
  Purpose: Specifies whether output to the printer is to be
           sent through Print Manager. Changing this value
           to no disables Print Manager.
  To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
TransmissionRetryTimeout=<seconds>
  Default: 45
  Purpose: Specifies the default amount of time to give
           Windows for attempted transmission retries. A
           value is saved for each printer in the
           [PrinterPorts] section. If a successful
           transmission does not occur during this time,
           Windows posts a message box stating that the
           printer is not receiving characters.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file. This
           setting serves only as the system default value.
           To change the value for a particular printer,
           choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel
           window. Using Control Panel changes the
           corresponding value only in the [PrinterPorts]
           section.
------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------

[DESKTOP] SECTION

The [desktop] section contains optional settings that
control the appearance of the screen background (desktop)
and the positioning of windows and icons on the screen.

The [desktop] section can contain the following settings:

------------------------------------------------------------
GridGranularity=<number>
  Default: 0
  Purpose: Specifies the size (in units of eight pixels)
           of the grid that Windows uses to position
           windows on the screen. The allowed range is 0
           through 49.
  To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
IconSpacing=<pixels>
  Default: 77
  Purpose: Specifies the number of pixels that will appear
           between icons. Increasing this number increases
           the amount of space between icons.
  To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
Pattern=<b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8>
  Default: "(None)"  (This string appears when no pattern
                      is specified)
  Purpose: Specifies a pattern that is used to paint the
           screen background. The eight numeric values
           define a bitmap eight pixels wide and eight
           pixels high. Each decimal value represents a
           byte, and each byte represents a row of eight
           pixels. The following shows the effect of setting
           a bit:

           Setting   Effect
           -------   ------
              0      Sets the corresponding pixel to the
                     background color (specified by the
                     Background setting in the [colors]
                     section).

              1      Sets the corresponding pixel to the
                     foreground color (specified by the
                     WindowText setting in the [colors]
                     section).

           For example, if you set the <b1> value to the
           decimal value 175, the top row of pixels in the
           bitmap will appear as the binary equivalent
           (10101111) according to the preceding table.

  To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
TileWallpaper=<0-or-1>
  Default: 0
  Purpose: Specifies whether to tile the desktop wallpaper
           across the screen (set this value to 0) or to
           center it (set this value to 1).
  To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
Wallpaper=<bitmap-filename>
  Default: "(None)"  (This string appears when no pattern
                      is specified)
  Purpose: Supplies the name of a bitmap file. This bitmap
           appears on the screen background. You need to
           include the full pathname of the file if it is
           not in the Windows or system directory.
  To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel
           window.
------------------------------------------------------------
WallpaperOriginX=<x-coordinate>
  Default: 0
  Purpose: Adjusts the initial offset of a tiled wallpaper.
           The x-origin (default value) is the left side
           of the screen.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
WallpaperOriginY=<y-coordinate>
  Default: 0
  Purpose: Adjusts the initial offset of a tiled wallpaper.
           The y-origin (default value) is the top of the
           screen.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------

[EXTENSIONS] SECTION

The [extensions] section contains settings that link groups
of document files with an application so that opening one of
the document files automatically starts the application.

The [extensions] section can contain settings of the
following type:

------------------------------------------------------------
<extension>=<command-line>

  Purpose: Contains a list of filename extensions that
           identify documents, and corresponding command
           lines that are invoked when you choose a file
           that has the associated extensions.

           The <extension> keyname is an extension of one to
           three characters. The <command-line> value is an
           ordinary DOS command line. The command line
           always begins with an application filename (with
           the .EXE extension). This can be followed by any
           command parameters the application needs, usually
           including the document filename. The caret (^)
           character can be used when the original document
           filename is needed in the command line; the caret
           is replaced by the document filename without any
           extension. The most typical <extension> entries
           simply list the application name and the document
           name; for example:

             CAL=CALENDAR.EXE ^.CAL

           If you run a file called MYFILE.CAL after this
           association has been made, the Calendar progam
           will start and automatically open the file named
           MYFILE.

  To change: Choose Associate from the File menu in File
           Manager.
