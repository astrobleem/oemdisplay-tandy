  NOTE: This is the third of three files containing
        information about the SYSTEM.INI file. For general
        information about SYSTEM.INI and the listings in
        this file, read the introductory material in the
        SYSINI.TXT file.

  WARNING: If you change a setting incorrectly in
           SYSTEM.INI, you might disable your system. Before
           changing any setting, read "Changing Settings"
           in the SYSINI.TXT file.


------------------------------------------------------------
Keyboard=<filename-or-*devicename> (See "Device=", above)
  Default: none (Setup assigns an appropriate value based on
             your system configuration.)
  Purpose: Specifies the keyboard driver that is being used
           with Windows in 386 enhanced mode. This setting
           is a synonym for Device=.
  To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window.
------------------------------------------------------------
KeyBoostTime=<seconds>
  Default: .001
  Purpose: Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) an
           application gets to run with increased priority
           when it receives a keystroke. You can use this
           setting to increase the response to keystrokes
           when several background applications are running.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
KeyBufferDelay=<seconds>
  Default: .2
  Purpose: Specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to
           delay pasting keyboard input after the keyboard
           buffer is full. Some applications might require
           more than .2 seconds.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
-----------------------------------------------------------
KeyIdleDelay=<seconds>
  Default: .5
  Purpose: Specifies how much time Windows ignores idle
           calls after simulating a keystroke into a
           virtual machine. You can set this value to 0
           to speed up keyboard input, but some applications
           might respond sluggishly if you do.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
KeyPasteDelay=<seconds>
  Default: .003
  Purpose: Specifies how much time (in seconds) to wait
           before pasting any characters after a key has
           been pasted. Some applications might require more
           time than .003 seconds for recognition of a
           keystroke.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
KeyPasteTimeout=<seconds>
  Default: 1
  Purpose: Specifies how much time (in seconds) to allow an
           application to make the necessary BIOS calls for
           reading keyboard input before Windows will change
           from the fast paste (INT16h) to the slow paste
           (INT9h) mechanism.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
Local=<device-name>
  Default: none (In a standard SYSTEM.INI file, Setup will
            set Local=CON. See "Purpose.")
  Purpose: Defines MS-DOS device drivers that need to be
           local to each virtual machine. The <device-name>
           value must exactly match the case of the device
           name, or this setting will not work. (Most device
           names are in all captial letters, therefore this
           value must usually be in all caps.) If a device
           driver is local, a separate copy of it will exist
           in each virtual machine, and each will keep
           different state information. Most device drivers
           will not function properly when this setting is
           used. An exception is CON, the DOS console
           device, which should be local to avoid filling a
           buffer with input from multiple virtual machines.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
LPT1AutoAssign=<seconds>
LPT2AutoAssign=<seconds>
LPT3AutoAssign=<seconds>
LPT4AutoAssign=<seconds>
  Default: 60
  Purpose: Indicates the contention detection value for each
           connected port. Windows uses these values to
           determine how to arbitrate requests for the use
           of a device by more than one application, at
           least one of which is a non-Windows application.
           If the value is -1, Windows will display a
           warning message that asks the user which
           application should be given control of the port.
           If the value is 0, any application can use the
           device at any time. If the value is a positive
           integer less than 1,000, this value represents
           the number of seconds after an application stops
           using the device before another application can
           use the same device.
  To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control
           Panel window.
------------------------------------------------------------
MapPhysAddress=<range>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Specifies the address range (in megabytes) in
           which the memory manager will preallocate
           physical page-table entries and linear address
           space. Use this setting if you are using a DOS
           device driver (such as an older version of
           RAMDrive that uses extended memory) that needs
           this contiguous memory.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
MaxPagingFileSize=<kilobytes>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Specifies the maximum size (in kilobytes) for a
           temporary swap file.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
MinTimeSlice=<milliseconds>
  Default: 20
  Purpose: Specifies the minimum amount of time (in
           milliseconds) a virtual machine will be allowed
           to run before other virtual machines can take
           over. A smaller value (such as 10 milliseconds)
           will make multitasking appear smoother, but will
           diminish the overall system performance.
  To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control
           Panel window.
------------------------------------------------------------
MinUserDiskSpace=<kilobytes>
  Default: 500
  Purpose: Tells Windows how much disk space (in kilobytes)
           to leave free when creating a temporary swap
           file. You would want to use this setting if your
           system's paging drive has less available space
           than Windows can use for paging. This setting has
           no effect if a permanent swap file exists.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
Mouse=<filename-or-*devicename> (See "Device=", above)
  Default: none (Setup assigns an appropriate value based on
             your system configuration.)
  Purpose: Specifies the virtual device that handles the
           mouse hardware in 386 enhanced mode. This setting
           is a synonym for Device=.
  To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window.
------------------------------------------------------------
MouseSoftInit=<Boolean>
  Default: true
  Purpose: Specifies whether Windows should convert INT 33h
           function 0 hard initialization calls to function
           33 soft initialization calls, which do not reset
           the mouse hardware. Leaving this switch enabled
           allows you to use a mouse with a non-Windows
           application that you start in a window. Disable
           this setting if you are having problems
           (extraneous display output or a distorted cursor)
           using the mouse with an application. If you
           disable this setting, you will not be able to use
           the mouse with a non-Windows application that you
           start in a window.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
NetAsynchFallback=<Boolean>
  Default: false
  Purpose: If enabled, tells Windows to attempt to save a
           failing NetBIOS request. When an application
           issues an asynchronous NetBIOS request, Windows
           will attempt to allocate space in its global
           network buffer to receive the data. If there is
           insufficient space in the global buffer, Windows
           will normally fail the NetBIOS request. If this
           setting is enabled, Windows will attempt to save
           such a request by allocating a buffer in local
           memory and preventing any other virtual machines
           from running until the data is received and the
           timeout period (specified by the NetAsynchTimeout
           setting) expires.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
NetAsynchTimeout=<seconds>
  Default: 5.0
  Purpose: Specifies the timeout period (in seconds) when
           Windows needs to enter a critical section in
           order to service an asynchronous NetBIOS request.
           It is used only when NetAsynchFallback is
           enabled. This value can include a decimal (such
           as 0.5).
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
NetDMASize=<kilobytes>
  Default: 32 on Micro Channel (TM) machines
           0 on non-Micro Channel machines
  Purpose: Specifies the DMA buffer size (in kilobytes) for
           NetBIOS transport software if a network has been
           installed. In this case, the buffer size is the
           larger value between this value and the value of
           DMABufferSize.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
NetHeapSize=<kilobytes>
  Default: 12
  Purpose: Specifies the size (in kilobytes) of the buffers
           that Windows in 386 enhanced mode allocates in
           conventional memory for transferring data over a
           network. All values are rounded up to the nearest
           4K.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
Network=<filename-or-*devicename> (See "Device=", above)
  Default: none (Setup assigns an appropriate value based on
             your system configuration.)
  Purpose: Specifies the type of network you are using
           with Windows in 386 enhanced mode. This setting
           is a synonym for Device=.
  To change: Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window.
------------------------------------------------------------
NMIReboot=<Boolean>
  Default: no
  Purpose: If enabled, causes a reboot to occur when a
           nonmaskable interrupt is received.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
NoEMMDriver=<Boolean>
  Default: false
  Purpose: If enabled, prevents Windows in 386 enhanced mode
           from installing its expanded memory driver. This
           differs from setting EMMSize to zero, which does
           not prevent the EMM driver from being loaded.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
Paging=<Boolean>
  Default: yes
  Purpose: Enables or disables demand paging (virtual
           memory). You would disable this setting only if
           you need the disk space normally used for a
           temporary swap file.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
PagingDrive=<drive-letter>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Specifies the disk drive where Windows in 386
           enhanced mode will allocate a temporary swap
           file. This setting is ignored if you have a
           permanent swap file. If you don't have a
           permanent swap file and no drive is specified or
           the specified drive does not exist, Windows will
           attempt to put your temporary swap file on the
           drive containing your SYSTEM.INI file. If the
           specified drive is full, paging will be disabled.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
PerVMFILES=<number>
  Default: 10
  Purpose: Specifies the number of private file handles
           Windows should allocate to each virtual machine.
           Increase this value if an application does not
           have enough file handles to run. The total number
           of file handles, including the global handles
           specified in the FILES= statement in CONFIG.SYS,
           cannot exceed 255. If it does exceed 255, this
           value will be rounded down. Set this value to 0
           to prevent the allocation of any private file
           handles.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
PSPIncrement=<number>
  Default: 2
  Purpose: Specifies the amount of additional memory, in
           16-byte increments, that Windows should reserve
           in each successive virtual machine when the
           UniqueDOSPSP setting is enabled. The setting that
           will work best for your machine might vary
           depending on your memory configuration and the
           applications you are running. Valid values are 2
           through 64. See UniqueDosPSP for more
           information.
 To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
ReflectDosInt2A=<Boolean>
  Default: false
  Purpose: Indicates whether Windows should consume or
           reflect DOS INT 2A signals. The default means
           Windows will consume these signals and therefore
           run more efficiently. Enable this setting if you
           are running memory-resident software that relies
           on detecting INT2A messages.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
ReservePageFrame=<Boolean>
  Default: true
  Purpose: Tells Windows whether to give preference to EMS
           page frame space or conventional memory when it
           has to use one of the two to allocate DOS
           transfer buffers. This choice is necessary when
           Windows can not find space between 640K and 1MB
           other than EMS page frame space. If enabled, this
           setting will preserve EMS page frame space at the
           expense of conventional memory. If you are not
           going to run non-Windows applications that use
           expanded memory, you can disable this setting to
           give non-Windows applications more conventional
           memory.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SGrabLPT=<port-number>
  Default: none
  Purpose: Routes all printer interrupts on the specified
           port to the system virtual machine rather than to
           the current virtual machine.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SystemROMBreakPoint=<Boolean>
  Default: true
  Purpose: Specifies whether Windows should use ROM address
           space between F000:0000 and 1MB for a break
           point. Windows in 386 enhanced mode normally
           searches this space to find a special instruction
           that is used as a system break point. If this
           address space contains something other than
           permanently available ROM, you should disable
           this setting.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMEMSLimit=<kilobytes>
  Default: 2048
  Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of expanded memory
           Windows should be permitted to use. Setting this
           value to 0 prevents Windows from gaining access
           to any expanded memory. Setting it to -1 gives
           Windows all the available expanded memory that it
           requests.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMEMSLocked=<Boolean>
  Default: no
  Purpose: Indicates whether to swap Windows' expanded
           memory to the hard disk. Locking expanded memory
           can improve the performance of a Windows
           application that uses it, but locking it slows
           down the rest of the system.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMEMSRequired=<kilobytes>
  Default: 0
  Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of expanded memory
           must be free in order to start Windows. Leave
           this setting at zero if no Windows application
           requires expanded memory.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMV86Locked=<Boolean>
  Default: false
  Purpose: If enabled, causes the virtual-mode memory being
           used in the system virtual machine to remain
           locked in memory rather that being swappable out
           to disk. Because Windows handles this process,
           there is no known reason to enable this setting.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMXMSLimit=<kilobytes>
  Default: 2048
  Purpose: Specifies the maximum amount of memory (in
           kilobytes) the extended memory driver will
           allocate to DOS device drivers and memory-
           resident software in the system virtual machine.
           Set the value to -1 to give an application all
           the available extended memory that it requests.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMXMSLocked=<Boolean>
  Default: no
  Purpose: Indicates whether to swap the memory allocated by
           the extended memory driver to the hard disk.
           Locking the XMS memory (enabling this setting)
           can improve an application's performance, but it
           slows down the rest of the system.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
SysVMXMSRequired=<kilobytes>
  Default: 0
  Purpose: Specifies how many kilobytes of extended memory
           must be reserved by the XMS driver in order to
           start Windows. Leave this setting at zero if
           there are no XMS users in the system virtual
           machine.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
TimerCriticalSection=<milliseconds>
  Default: 0
  Purpose: Instructs Windows to go into a critical section
           around all timer interrupt code, and specifies
           a timeout period (in milliseconds). Specifying
           a positive value will assure that only one
           virtual machine at a time will receive timer
           interrupts. Some networks and other global
           memory-resident software may fail unless this
           setting is used. However, using it will slow
           down performance and can make the system
           sluggish or seem to stop for short periods of
           time.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
TokenRingSearch=<Boolean>
  Default: true
  Purpose: Tells Windows whether to search for a token ring
           network adapter on machines with IBM PC/AT (R)
           architecture. Disable this setting if you are not
           using a token ring card and the search interferes
           with another device.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
TranslateScans=<Boolean>
  Default: no
  Purpose: Indicates whether Windows will translate a
           keyboard's scan codes to make them compatible
           with standard IBM scan codes. This setting is
           necessary only for keyboards that generate non-
           standard scan codes. This setting is used only
           for the Switcher Screen and message boxes.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
UniqueDOSPSP=<Boolean>
  Default: false (see below for exception)
  Purpose: If enabled, tells Windows to start every
           application at a unique address (PSP). Each time
           Windows creates a new virtual machine to start
           a new application, Windows reserves a unique
           amount of memory (i bytes) below the application.
           For example, the first application would be
           loaded at address M, the second at address M+i,
           the third at M+2i, and so forth. The amount of
           memory i is determined by the PSPIncrement
           setting (earlier in this section). These settings
           should help assure that applications in different
           virtual machines all start at different
           addresses. Some networks use applications' load
           addresses to identify the different processes
           using the network. On such networks, failing to
           enable this setting might cause one application
           to fail when you exit another, because the
           network interprets them as the same. However,
           enabling this setting will leave slightly less
           memory for non-Windows applications. If you are
           running a network based on Microsoft Network or
           LAN Manager, the default value is true. See the
           NETWORKS.TXT online document to find out whether
           the network you are running is one of these.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
UseInstFile=<Boolean>
  Default: false
  Purpose: Specifies whether Windows should look in the
           INSTANCE.386 file for information it can use to
           determine whether data structures within DOS need
           to be local. There are two other methods for
           giving Windows this information: internal tables
           within the device, and an INT 2Fh call documented
           in the OEM Adaptation Kit. Both methods are
           preferable to using this setting; it is provided
           only for compatibility with Windows/386 version
           2.x.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
VCPIWarning=<Boolean>
  Default: true
  Purpose: Specifies whether Windows should display a
           warning message when an application attempts to
           use the Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI),
           which Windows does not support. Disable this
           setting if you do not want to see this message
           every time you run software that does a VCPI call
           but still runs without this support.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
VirtualHDIrq=<Boolean>
  Default: on
  Purpose: Allows Windows in 386 enhanced mode to terminate
           interrupts from the hard disk controller,
           bypassing the ROM routine that handles these
           interrupts. Some hard drives might require that
           this setting be disabled in order for interrupts
           to be processed correctly. If this setting is
           disabled, the ROM routine handles the interrupts,
           which slows the system's performance.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
WindowKBRequired=<kilobytes>
  Default: 256
  Purpose: Specifies how much conventional memory (in
           kilobytes) must be free in order to start
           Windows.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
WindowMemSize=<number-or-kilobytes>
  Default: -1
  Purpose: Limits the amount of conventional memory Windows
           can use for itself. The default value (-1)
           indicates that Windows can use as much of this
           space as it needs. You can try entering a
           positive value less than 640 if there is not
           enough memory to run Windows in 386 enhanced
           mode.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
WindowUpdateTime=<milliseconds>
  Default: 50
  Purpose: Specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds)
           Windows takes between updates of the display for
           a windowed non-Windows application.
  To change: Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
------------------------------------------------------------
WinExclusive=<Boolean>
  Default: no
  Purpose: Indicates whether Windows always gets all of the
           computer's processing time whenever a Windows
           application is in the foreground. If this setting
           is enabled and a Windows application is in the
           foreground, no non-Windows application will run.
  To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control
           Panel window.
------------------------------------------------------------
WinTimeSlice=<number,number>
  Default: 100,50
  Purpose: This setting contains two numbers. The first
           number specifies the relative amount of
           processing time (based on the MinTimeSlice
           setting) given to all Windows applications
           running in the foreground relative to the time
           allocated to all non-Windows applications running
           in the background. The second number specifies
           the relative amount of processing time given to
           all Windows applications running in the
           background when a non-Windows application is
           running in the foreground. The range of numbers
           that can be entered is 1 through 10000. The
           important value is the ratio of these settings to
           the corresponding settings in the program
           information files (PIFs) of the active non-
           Windows applications.
  To change: Choose the 386 Enhanced icon from the Control
           Panel window.
