If a Help button is available in the Printer Setup dialog box, 
review the Help information for your printer's specific driver. 
Also review Chapter 5, "Control Panel," in the Windows User's 
Guide for descriptions of printer settings, more information on 
installing and configuring your printer driver, and instructions 
for printing over a network. For information about printing 
with Windows Print Manager, see Chapter 6, "Print Manager,"  
in the Windows User's Guide.


INSTALLING YOUR PRINTER
=======================

Most of the printer drivers provided with Windows work for more
than one printer model. This means that you must install and 
configure the settings for your specific printer model.

Before you try to print, complete all of the steps in the 
following installation procedure:

  1.  Choose the Printers icon from Control Panel. (Control 
      Panel is located in the Main group of Program Manager.)

  2.  Choose Add Printer from the Printers dialog box.

  3.  Select the name of the printer model you want to install.

  4.  Choose Install.

  5.  Follow the dialog box instructions about inserting the 
      printer-driver disk (or specifying the path to the driver)
      and choose OK.

  6.  Choose Configure from the Printers dialog box.

  7.  Select the port used by the printer you are installing.

  8.  Choose Setup.

  9.  Select the printer model you want to use and change the 
      standard settings to match your needs.

  10. Choose OK three times to return to Control Panel.

For more information about the printer installation procedure, 
see Chapter 5, "Control Panel," in the Windows User's Guide.

  NOTE: Do not try to copy files directly from the disks that 
        came with Windows. All the files on the Windows disks 
	are in a compressed format that must be converted 
	before the files can be used by Windows. Control Panel 
	makes the printer driver files usable.


PRINTING EXTENDED ANSI OR INTERNATIONAL CHARACTERS
==================================================

Windows supports the ANSI character set. In addition to the 
128 standard ASCII characters you can enter from your keyboard, 
you can enter extended or international characters. See 
Appendix B, "Special Characters," in the Windows User's Guide 
for the ANSI character set table and instructions.

Even though you can enter extended characters into applications
and see them on the screen, your printer might not be able to 
print these characters. See your printer manual or contact your 
printer manufacturer for more information about your printer's 
support of extended characters.

When Windows prints a file, each character you typed in your 
application is translated from the ANSI character to the 
appropriate character on your printer. If your printer supports 
the same character, it will be printed. Otherwise, some other 
character will print. You might see a period or other filler 
character instead.

Check your printer manual and experiment with your printer to 
determine which extended characters are supported.

  NOTE: This limitation applies only to the printer's hardware
        fonts. Fonts provided by Windows will print the 
	extended ANSI characters. See the next topic for a 
	list of fonts that Windows provides.


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DISPLAYED AND PRINTED FONTS
===============================================

Windows supplies several different types of fonts for displaying 
characters on the screen:

  Font             Description
  ----             ------------------------------------------
  Helv (raster)    Proportional font (characters have varying 
		   widths) without serifs ("sans serif")

  Tms Rmn (raster) Proportional font with serifs

  Courier (raster) Fixed-pitch font (characters have uniform 
                   widths) with serifs

  Symbol (raster)  Proportional font for mathematical symbols

  Roman (vector)   Proportional font with serifs

  Modern (vector)  Proportional font without serifs

  Script (vector)  Proportional font of slanted characters 
                   with a script-like appearance

Raster (or screen) fonts are used mainly for the screen and can 
be printed on most printers.

Vector fonts are used mainly for plotter or other vector-type 
devices. These fonts can also be used on the screen and for 
printing on most printers, but generally the appearance is
not of as high a quality as raster fonts provide.

Windows determines which font to display on the screen by 
matching the screen font as closely as possible with the 
printer font you've selected. In some cases, the characters on
your screen will look exactly like the printed characters. In 
other cases, there will be no matching screen font available, 
so the characters on your screen will look different from the 
printed characters.

With most dot-matrix printers, the font size is a measure of 
the width of characters (characters per inch or CPI). Windows,
however, measures screen fonts by height in point sizes. As a 
result, the screen fonts for some dot-matrix printers will not 
change size even as you change their CPI measurement. Only 
their positions on the page and the position of the end of 
lines will change to match the printed output. 

For proportionally spaced fonts on laser printers, the widths 
for particular characters, as they appear on your screen, might
not match the widths for those same characters on the printed 
output. To accommodate this difference, Windows displays the 
horizontal position of each character and the position of
the ends of lines as they appear when printed.

In most applications that provide a ruler (e.g., Write), any 
discrepancies in ruler measurements reflect the size 
differences between the screen font and the printer font, as
discussed earlier.


FORMATTING FONTS FOR DOT-MATRIX PRINTERS
========================================
Most dot-matrix printers measure font sizes in characters per 
inch (CPI). These fonts are generally the same height with 
varying widths. Windows measures font sizes by number of 
points in the font's height.

Some applications list each font size for dot-matrix printer 
fonts as a font name. Because fonts with the same height can 
have various widths, the point size in the Sizes list box 
might not change as you change font names.

For example, in Write, you might see the following fonts listed
in the Fonts dialog box:


  Fonts:                Sizes:
  ---------------       ------
  | Roman 10cpi |       | 10 |
  | Roman 12cpi |       |    |
  | Roman 15cpi |       |    |
  | Roman 17cpi |       ------
  | Roman 20cpi |
  | Roman 5cpi  |
  | Roman 6cpi  |
  ---------------


You can choose the appropriate font and size by selecting the 
font name and size from the respective lists. Because the 
height of these fonts does not change, the number in the Sizes
list box remains constant regardless of the font you choose.

See the preceding topic, "Differences Between Displayed and 
Printed Fonts," for more information on how different types of 
fonts are displayed on the screen.


PRINTING COLOR FROM PAINTBRUSH
==============================	

Not all color printers have drivers that support color printing
from Paintbrush. Unless you have a color PostScript or HP 
PaintJet printer, your color images might print only in black 
and white.

If your printer is not a color PostScript or an HP PaintJet, 
you might get better results if you cancel the Color option in 
the Printer Setup dialog box. 


USING PRINT MANAGER WITH A NETWORK PRINTER
==========================================

The availability of some Print Manager features depends on your 
network software. To find out which features are supported by 
the network you use, see the NETWORKS.TXT on-line document. 
This document also contains other important information about 
networks that was not included in the Windows User's Guide or 
in on-line Help.


PRINTING WITHOUT PRINT MANAGER
==============================

If you have cleared the Use Print Manager check box in Control 
Panel and try to print from more than one application at the 
same time, you will see an error message indicating that you 
cannot print. With Print Manager canceled, you must wait until 
one printing job is complete before sending another one to the 
printer.


NOTES ON SPECIFIC PRINTERS
==========================

The information in this section applies to problems you might 
have using a specific printer with Windows. Recommended
remedies are included.


Printing with PostScript Cartridges
-----------------------------------
To use add-on PostScript cartridges with Windows, you must set up 
Windows with a PostScript printer driver. To do this, choose the 
Control Panel from Program Manager's Main Group and follow the 
steps outlined in "Installing Your Printer" at the beginning of 
this document. Select the Apple Laserwriter Plus [PostScript] or 
another PostScript-type printer from the list of printer models.

  NOTE:  PostScript cartridges are not directly supported by the 
         PostScript printer driver.


Printing Microsoft Word for Windows with an HP Plotter Driver
-------------------------------------------------------------
The HP Plotter will not print borders with Microsoft Word for 
Windows version 1.00.


Printing with Symbol Fonts and Microsoft Word for Windows
---------------------------------------------------------
Before you can print Symbol fonts with your HP PCL printer,
you must install special printer information files. You can 
find installation instructions under "Symbol Soft Fonts HP PCL 
Printers" in the "Information About New Features" section of 
the README.DOC file for Microsoft Word for Windows version 1.00. 


Using Bitstream Fontware 3.0 with Canon LBP-811 or HP PaintJet
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use Bitstream Fontware 3.0 with Canon LBP-8II 
or HP PaintJet series printer drivers you must follow 
additional installation procedures after you complete the 
Control Panel printer setup.

  *  For the Canon LBP-8II, follow the instructions in your 
     Fontware 3.0 documentation to install and make the fonts. 

     To use the fonts you installed, edit your WIN.INI file as
     outlined in the following steps:

  1.  Start Windows Notepad.

  2.  Choose Open from the File menu and choose WIN.INI from 
      your Windows directory.

  3.  Choose Search from the Edit menu and locate 
      [Canon LBP8II Europe].

  4.  Select all the lines starting with "softfontN =...".
  5.  Choose Copy from the Edit menu.

  6.  Use Search again to locate [Canon LBP-8II].

  7.  Place the insertion cursor at the beginning of the next 
      line.

  8.  Choose Paste from the Edit menu.

  9.  Close Notepad.

  *  For the HP PaintJet series printers, install and make the 
     fonts as instructed in your Fontware 3.0 documentation. 
     Then start Control Panel and choose the Printer icon. 
     Follow the Help instructions in the Printer Setup dialog 
     box on using the Fonts option for the HP PaintJet series 
     printer. Also, see the Help topic, "Adding and Removing 
     Soft Fonts," in the Setup dialog box for the HP PaintJet 
     series .


Adjusting HP Plotter Margins
----------------------------
If you are using one of the following plotters, you can 
probably correct problems with margins by experimenting with 
the margin settings in the application and turning on the 
Expand mode on your plotter.

  *  HP 7580 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
  *  HP 7585 A,B (hardware switch on back panel, pin #9)
  *  HP DraftPro DXL, EXL (hardware switch on back panel, 
      pin #9)
  *  DraftMaster I, II (front panel selection)

Turning on the Expand switch increases the plotting area by 
setting the outer margins to the area under the grid wheels. 
This gives you a greater printable area, although it might 
decrease plot quality.


Installing and Using Softfonts on the IBM Laser Printer 4019
------------------------------------------------------------
The IBM Laser Printer 4019 printer driver allows up to 99 
softfonts. You can install and remove softfonts for the 4019 
by using Windows Control Panel or the Printer Setup in your 
Windows application.

For instructions on configuring printer settings, see Chapter 5, 
"Control Panel," in the Windows User's Guide.


Printing with IBM Proprinter X24 OR XL24, 
Epson MX-80, or Okidata(R) 24-Pin
-----------------------------------------
You might experience erratic output while printing with these 
dot-matrix printers using Windows Print Manager because Print 
Manager sometimes interrupts the flow of data while printing. 
These printers cannot accommodate interruptions in data flow. 
Disabling Print Manager causes the data to be sent in one 
continuous stream.

(This problem should not occur on the IBM Proprinter X24e or 
the IBM Proprinter XL24e.)


To cancel Print Manager:

  1.  Choose the Printers icon from Control Panel. (Control 
      Panel is located in the Main Group of Program Manager.)

  2.  Clear the Use Print Manager check box.

  3.  Choose OK.


If you still have problems after disabling Print Manager, you 
can print to a file and send that file to your printer. To do 
so, connect to the port called FILE, make it Active, and choose 
the print command for the application. Then copy the print file 
to your printer port.  

See Chapter 5, "Control Panel," in the Windows User's Guide for
more information on printing to a file. See your MS-DOS manual 
for information on copying files to your printer port.


Printing with IBM Personal Pageprinter on EPT 
---------------------------------------------
For best results, use the IBM Personal Pageprinter Adapter
Program Version 1.3.1 or later.

If you want to print from an IBM Personal Pageprinter with EPT 
in 386 Enhanced mode, you must set the 386 Enhanced LPT1 device 
contention to never issue a warning. This is only for 386 
enhanced mode. Standard and real modes do not require special 
settings.

To change the device contention warning, follow these steps:

  1.  Choose the Control Panel icon from Program Manager.

  2.  Choose the 386 enhanced-mode icon and select the LPT1 
      port.

  3.  Select the Never Warn option button in the Device 
      Contention area.

  4.  Choose OK.


Extended ANSI Character Support with Epson LQ Printers
------------------------------------------------------
You will be able to print the extended ANSI characters 
(character values 128 through 255) only on the following 
Epson LQ printers:

  LQ-500
  LQ-2500
  LQ-850
  LQ-1050

Other Epson LQ printer models do not provide support for these 
characters and are not available to Windows when printing with 
the printer's hardware fonts.

  NOTE:  This limitation applies only to the printer's hardware 
         fonts. Fonts provided by Windows will print the 
         extended ANSI characters above 128.


Printing with Fujitsu Dot-Matrix Printers
-----------------------------------------
  *  The manual-feed option is not supported with Fujitsu 
     dot-matrix printers. All paper is fed to the printer 
     automatically from the roller.

  *  You can print only in black and white from Paintbrush. 
     For best results, turn off the Color option in Paintbrush.
     See "Printing Color from Paintbrush" earlier in this 
     document for more information.


Duplex Printing Multiple Copies with PCL/HP LaserJet Printers
-------------------------------------------------------------
The HP LaserJet IID and HP LaserJet 2000 printers can print 
duplex (two-sided) copies. If you print in duplex mode, set the
number of copies from the PCL/HP LaserJet Printer Setup dialog
box, not from your Windows application. 

To learn more about setting up your printer for duplex printing,
press F1 to see Help when you install the printer. After the 
printer is installed, you can see Help by following these 
steps:

  1.  Choose the Printers icon from Control Panel.

  2.  Select your PCL/HP LaserJet installed printer and choose
      the Configure button from the Printers dialog box.

  3.  Choose the Setup button from the Printers-Configure 
      dialog box.

  4.  Select PCL/HP LaserJet from the drop-down list box and 
      choose the Help button.


Installing Softfonts with the HP PaintJet Series
------------------------------------------------

The HP PaintJet Series printer driver allows up to 25 softfonts
to be installed at one time. You might be able to add more than 
25 fonts, but only the first 25 are listed as currently 
available. If you want to use additional fonts, you must 
remove some of the 25 fonts.

For instructions on configuring printer settings, see Chapter 5, 
"Control Panel," in the Windows User's Guide. For more 
information on installing softfonts, see the Help topic, 
"Adding and Removing Soft Fonts," in the Setup dialog box for
the HP PaintJet Series.
